# PFMC-SIS
Getting assessment results into the Species Information System

The SIS database is only available to NOAA staff 
(see https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/species-information-system for info),
but provides the source for information in the public 
Stock SMART web tool: https://apps-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/stocksmart?app=homepage

This repository is intended to store R code and other information related to getting output from the 
stock assessments adopted by the PFMC into SIS.
